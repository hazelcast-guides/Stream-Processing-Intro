// Give some context about the use case for this tutorial. What will the reader learn?
== Context

image::diagram.jpg[]

In this tutorial, you will build, step by step, a simple e-commerce order processing application. 

Step 1: Connect to the streaming data source.
Step 2: Import customer and inventory databases.
Step 3: Generate pick-and-ship order
Step 4: Generate info for money collection
Step 5: Update inventory count

// Optional: What does the reader need before starting this tutorial? Think about tools or knowledge. Delete this section if your readers can dive straight into the lesson without requiring any prerequisite knowledge.
== Before you Begin

This tutorial is designed to be completed in conjunction with the Introduction to Stream Processing with Hazelcast course. Although you can complete this tutorial independently, the course provides operational context and additional information on Hazelcast. 

Before starting this tutorial, make sure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* Set up a Hazelcast Viridian cluster
* Open a Management Center session with the Viridian cluster
* Download the repository at https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/Stream-Processing-Intro


== Step 1. Connect to the Streaming Data Source

(Insert instructions here for setting up kafka)

. blahdiblah something about generating streaming data

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW orders AS
  SELECT id,

       CASE WHEN tickRand BETWEEN 0 AND 0.1 THEN '11001'
            WHEN tickRand BETWEEN 0.1 AND 0.2 THEN '11002'
            WHEN tickRand BETWEEN 0.2 AND 0.3 THEN '11003'
            WHEN tickRand BETWEEN 0.3 AND 0.4 THEN '11004'
            WHEN tickRand BETWEEN 0.4 AND 0.5 THEN '11005'
            WHEN tickRand BETWEEN 0.5 AND 0.6 THEN '11006'
            WHEN tickRand BETWEEN 0.6 AND 0.7 THEN '11007'
            WHEN tickRand BETWEEN 0.7 AND 0.8 THEN '11008'
            ELSE '11009'
       END as cust_id, 

       CASE WHEN tickRand*1.5 BETWEEN 0 AND 0.25 THEN 501
            WHEN tickRand*1.5 BETWEEN 0.25 AND 0.5 THEN 502
            WHEN tickRand*1.5 BETWEEN 0.5 AND 0.75 THEN 503
            ELSE 504
       END as item_num,

       CASE WHEN tickRand*.66 BETWEEN 0 AND .25 THEN 1.0
            WHEN tickRand*.66 BETWEEN .25 AND .5 THEN 2.0
            ELSE 3.0
       END as quantity,
       order_ts
FROM
    (SELECT v as id,
           RAND(v*v) as tickRand,
           TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ(v*10 + 1645484400000) as order_ts
     FROM TABLE(generate_stream(10))); 
```

== Step 2. Query Streaming Data

////
Continue the design approach you chose in the previous part and continue it through to the end of the tutorial.
////

== Step 3. Load Fast Data Store



== Summary

////
Summarise what knowledge the reader has gained by completing the tutorial, including a summary of each step's goals (this is a good way to validate whether your tutorial has covered all you need it to.)
